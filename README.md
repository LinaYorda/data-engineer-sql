# Associate Data Engineer in SQL

In this DataCamp career track, I'm immersing myself in essential data engineering concepts, mastering ETL/ELT workflows, and working with relational databases like PostgreSQL. I'm honing my SQL skills for querying, joining tables, and utilizing advanced techniques like subqueries and aggregation. The track also delves into database design principles, including star and snowflake schemas, and normalization, preparing me to handle tasks like table creation and data consistency. Additionally, I'm learning to install and configure PostgreSQL, manage users, and explore data warehouse technologies like Snowflake, a leading cloud solution for data engineering.

#### Project : Analyzing Students' Mental Health

Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out!

Use your data manipulation skills to explore the data from a study on the mental health of international students, and find out which factors may have the greatest impact.

#### Project : Explorinf London's Travel Network

How do Londoners get around? Transport for London (TfL) is a vast public transport network that allows London's residents to efficiently travel around the UK's capital, to the tune of over 1.5 million journeys per day!

In this introductory project, you will work with a Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Databricks database containing data on journeys and transport types in London between 2010 and 2022. You will write SQL queries to find the most popular transport methods, examine when the London cable car (which connects London's Royal Docks, where the Mayor's office is located, to Greenwich Peninsula, home of the O2 arena) was particularly busy, and identify rare periods when the Underground (also known as "the tube" to locals) was less busy.
