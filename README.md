# Associate Data Engineer in SQL

In this DataCamp career track, I'm immersing myself in essential data engineering concepts, mastering ETL/ELT workflows, and working with relational databases like PostgreSQL. I'm honing my SQL skills for querying, joining tables, and utilizing advanced techniques like subqueries and aggregation. The track also delves into database design principles, including star and snowflake schemas, and normalization, preparing me to handle tasks like table creation and data consistency. Additionally, I'm learning to install and configure PostgreSQL, manage users, and explore data warehouse technologies like Snowflake, a leading cloud solution for data engineering.

#### Project : Analyzing Students' Mental Health

Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out!

Use your data manipulation skills to explore the data from a study on the mental health of international students, and find out which factors may have the greatest impact.
